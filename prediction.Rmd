# Confidence & Prediction Intervals of the Dependent Variable

---
# Dependent Variable Predictions

- One reason to run a linear regression is to learn the relationship between X and Y so that you can use X to __predict__ Y.
- There are multiple examples of this practice in business applications
  - Accuaries use data about your demongraphics to predict your death and the likelihood of an accident.
  - Stock Brokers use news stories to predict changes in stock prices
  - Wine experts use rainfall to predict wine quality before maturity.

# But how how confident can we be in our prediction?

It is easy to use your model to predict. All you need to do is
- Use current data to estimate the model.
- Get the estimate coefficients
- Plug in new values for your explanatory variables to predict your dependent variable.

#### But there are some caveats

---

### Warnings about predictions

- Out of sample predictions perform poorly if your X's are too far out of the range in your sample
- __Example: Home prices__ 
 - Small and Large home are poorly estimated.
 - These values are too far outside of the range of the square foot variable.

## Confidence interval of a prediction

We know confidence intervals for a mean or for our point estimates $(\beta)$. 

- What if we want a confidence interval for our prediction?

Remember that Y is a function of X and some stuff we do not know (the error term).
 - X has a variance
 - The error term has a variance
 - Our point estimate has a variance
 - how do we combine all of this uncertainty?

## Prediction Interval formula

We know that the predicted value of the dependent variable is $$\hat{y}=\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_1}x^*$$
where $x^*$ is the value of x we want to use to predict y.

The confidence interval fromula is then, $$\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_1}x^*+t_{\alpha/2}*s_e*\sqrt{\frac{1}{m}+\frac{1}{n}+\frac{(x^*-\bar{x})^2}{\sum(x_i-\bar{x})^2}}$$
- For a prediciton interval, we assume $m = 1$
- For a confidence interval, we assume $m \rightarrow \infty$
- Confidence intervals are smaller than prediction intervals

### Prediction and Confidence intervals in R

#### Problem
In the data set faithful, develop a 95% prediction interval of the eruption duration for the waiting time of 80 minutes.

```{r}
attach(faithful)     # attach the data frame 
eruption.lm = lm(eruptions ~ waiting)
newdata = data.frame(waiting=80) # our value of X for prediction
predict(eruption.lm, newdata, interval="confidence")  # Confidense Interval
predict(eruption.lm, newdata, interval="predict") # Prediction Interval
```
- Both intervals have the same point estimate (center)
- The prediction interval is wider than the confidence interval
